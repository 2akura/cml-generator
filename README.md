CLASS : 

introduction :
this repository on my Final Year Project aka FYP, this site generating basic cmd's for cisco devices
its engine is built with rust ðŸ¦€, delivering :
- zero-cost abstraction, safety and performance without runtime overhead
- blazingly fast compile time, near native performance
- high performance meets low-level control

Below is the work breakdown structure of the project
```

```
FLOW :

USER lands on the site
 â””â”€ clicks a button
     â”œâ”€ href â†’ /switch or /router
     â””â”€ triggers navigation to the respective page
         â””â”€ on respective page ( switch / router ) :
           <form> (on submit)
            â†“ preventDefault()
            â†“ read form data (input.value, etc.)
            â†“ JS function (handles/validates/prepares)
            â†“ JSON â†’ Rust WASM call
            â†“ result from Rust â†’ back to JS
            â†“ update DOM / UI
```
```
WHY IS THIS PROJECT UNIQUE ? :

the gimmick of this project is that it's unlike any site's system, its utilizing jump table function for the lookup process -mapping command templates directly to tokenized instructions- this further enhance the speed of lookup process for faster output
