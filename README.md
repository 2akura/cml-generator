```
this repository on my Final Year Project aka FYP, this site generating basic cmd's for cisco devices
its engine is built with rust ðŸ¦€, delivering :
- zero-cost abstraction
- balzingly fast compile time, near native performance
- high performance meets low-level control

```


FLOW :

USER lands on the site
 â””â”€ clicks a button
     â”œâ”€ href â†’ /switch (or /router)
     â””â”€ triggers navigation to the respective page
         â””â”€<form> (on submit)
            â†“ preventDefault()
            â†“ read form data (input.value, etc.)
            â†“ JS function (handles/validates/prepares)
            â†“ JSON â†’ Rust WASM call
            â†“ result â†’ back to JS
            â†“ update DOM / UI
