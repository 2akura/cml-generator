introduction :
this repository on my Final Year Project aka FYP, this site generating basic cmd's for cisco devices
its engine is built with rust ðŸ¦€, delivering :
- zero-cost abstraction, safety and performance without runtime overhead
- blazingly fast compile time, near native performance
- high performance meets low-level control

Below is how the site works
```

```
flow :

USER lands on the site
 â””â”€ clicks a button
     â”œâ”€ href â†’ /switch or /router
     â””â”€ triggers navigation to the respective page
         â””â”€ on respective page (switch / router):
            â†“ user interacts with dropdowns / checkboxes / buttons
            â†“ each input is bound to an event listener
               - updates in-memory state object (JS)
            â†“ when user confirms (e.g., clicks "Apply" / "Save")
               â†“ gather state object (JSON)
               â†“ send JSON â†’ WASM call
               â†“ result from Rust â†’ back to JS
               â†“ update DOM / UI

```
```
WHY IS THIS PROJECT UNIQUE ? :

the gimmick is that it's unlike any site's that uses traditional implementations for lookup process,
utilizing matrix-table driven finite state machine algorithm -mapping grid templates directly to the data-
this further reduce engine's complexity and enhance the speed of the lookup process for faster output

```
Rust engine flow :
raw input 
   â†’ tokenizer with reverse token table
     - change input into token based on the reverse token table
     - log args into side table  
        â†’ Matrix Table-Driven FSM 
          - traverse token sequence on the matrix's grids
          - validate token's state
             â†’ assembler with foward token table
               - constructs token's value with FSM guided token sequence and foward table
               - fill in args by extract repective args from the side table

```

MORE ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
it's pure frontend, w/o any backend server, regardless of how it may seem
this is mainly beacues of budget
```
