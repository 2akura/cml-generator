introdution :
this repository on my Final Year Project aka FYP, this site generating basic cmd's for cisco devices
its engine is built with rust ðŸ¦€, delivering :
- zero-cost abstraction, safety and performance without runtime overhead
- blazingly fast compile time, near native performance
- high performance meets low-level control

Below is the work breakdown structure of the project
